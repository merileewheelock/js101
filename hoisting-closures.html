<!-- Scope
-Determines what can see a variable
1. Global: Top level, EVERYONE can see and change a global
     -In Python, these are indented all the way to the left
2. Local: Inside of a function, only visible internally and to child functions -->

<script type="text/javascript">
	
	var imAGlobal = 1;
	// This is a global variable. It belongs to the WINDOW object.
	function checkScope(){
		var imAGlobal = 2;
		// In spite of the misleading name, this is a local variable. It is NOT visible outside (above) this function
		console.log("Local var", imAGlobal); // This will print 2
		// Unless you have specific reason to do this, avoid the below
		// Putting window. in front of anything will access the global scope. We can still access the global variable even though we have a local variable with the same name, but we have to tell it we want the global copy
		console.log("Global var", window.imAGlobal); // This will print 1 (using the global value - window's copy)

		function child(){
			imAGlobal = 3;
			// If we wrote "var imAGlobal = 3" here, it would be a NEW variable that dies after we're outside of child()
			console.log("Inside of child", imAGlobal);
		}
		child();
		console.log("After child", imAGlobal);

// HOISTING
// Put your vars at the top od a function, or JS will do it for you

	// Global copy of x
	var x = 1;
	function hoistingTest(){
		// Based on scope, hoisingText can see the global x
		console.log(x);
		// Local copy of x
		var x = 2;
		// Because of hoisting, JS moves ALL vars up to the top of a function/scope/global immediately (without their value)
		//In the above order, line 37 will return undefined

		// JS changes to:
		var x;
		console.log(x);
		x = 2;
		// Just put all your variables at the top of a function

		y = 3
	}
	hoistingTest();
	console.log(y); // This will return 3. It it cannot find "var y" anywhere, it will assign y as a global variable. The child function looks up level after level for a var. If it never finds one, it adds the var to the global scope. AVOID THIS by always using var to declare.
